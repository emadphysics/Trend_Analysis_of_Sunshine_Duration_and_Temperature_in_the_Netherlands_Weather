# Trend Analysis of Sunshine Duration and Temperature in the Netherlands Weather : A Sign For Global Warming
n this study it was found that total sunshine duration has a decreasing trend for the period 1901-1912 and after that in contrast to most Western European countries there is an increasing trend. The long-term 1901-2019 course of sunshine duration and air temperature in the Netherlands exhibits a statistically significant positive linear trend.
The long-term 1901-2019 course of air temperature in the Netherlands confirms the results obtained in other places in the world and exhibits increasing climatic warming. The temperature increase in the Netherlands is quite visible each month, but it is the highest in summer, particularly in August and lowest in winter, specially in February. Statistical tests for the linear trend show that the trends are statistically significant for all months at a level higher than 95%. The annual courses of rates of change of air temperature and sunshine duration disclose the fact that sunshine duration and air temperature increases faster in April and May and the slowest changes of sunshine duration and air temperature occur in early July and August respectively. The Linear trends between monthly sunshine duration and monthly air temperature are significant p-values less than 5% for the months from April to October. The strongest correlation between sunshine duration and air temperature are in summer which means that the radiation factor influences the air temperature more than other factors . The present warming is influenced prob-ably by the air-quality improvement (brightening period)and an increase in sunshine duration.
